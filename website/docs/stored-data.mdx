# Stored Data

:::info

This page demonstrates usage of the `@1password/docusaurus-plugin-stored-data` plugin. It is used to consume data from both local and external sources and make it available via React hooks. Refer to the [package's README](https://github.com/1Password/docusaurus-extensions/blob/main/packages/docusaurus-plugin-stored-data) for detailed usage instructions.

:::

### RSS feed

This example configures the plugin to consume an RSS feed and then uses the `useStoredFeed` hook in a custom component to parse and render individual feed items.

### Stored code snippet

This example configures the plugin to consume an external [code snippet from GitHub](https://github.com/1Password/arboard/blob/master/examples/get_image.rs) and then uses the `useStoredData` hook right in the MDX file to print the result into a `<CodeBlock>` component.

<CodeBlock
  language="rust"
  title="/arboard/master/examples/get_image.rs"
  showLineNumbers>
  {useStoredData("arboard-get-image")}
</CodeBlock>

### Local files

This example configures the plugin to consume the contents of a local JSON file containing a list of 1Password repositories and then uses the `useStoredJson` hook in a custom component to parse and render each repo.
